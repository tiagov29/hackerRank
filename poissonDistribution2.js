// In this challenge, we go further with Poisson distributions.
// We recommend reviewing the previous challenge's Tutorial before attempting this problem.

// Task
// The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy a machine of either type A or type .
//  B. For each dayâ€™s operation:

// The number of repairs,Y , that machine B needs is a Poisson random variable with
//mean 0.88.
// The daily cost of operating A is .
// Ca = 160 + 40 X^2
// The number of repairs,Y , that machine B needs is a Poisson random variable with
// 1.55 mean.
// The daily cost of operating B is .
// Cb = 128 + 40Y^2
// Assume that the repairs take a negligible amount of time and the machines are maintained
//  nightly to ensure that they operate like new at the start of each day.
//  Find and print the expected daily cost for each machine.
